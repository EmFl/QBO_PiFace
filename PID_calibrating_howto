To calibrate pid servo control 

To calibrate the servos control, you can run some of the tracking programs (PiFace or PÃ®FaceFast) from a console.
Then you can run PiCmd.py from another console.
And finally PiCmdListen from a third console.

To test different PID configurations, enter the following command in the console where we have executed PiCmdListen. py:

QBO_>>> -c pid -x 1 -p 32 8 16

where -x indicates the servo to be configured, and -p indicates the three PID parameters.

Warning: changing the PID parameters while the servo has not finished a movement can cause a sudden servo movement.
